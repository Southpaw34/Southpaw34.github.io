            this website has many helpful resources for playing music on a saxophone, such as:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Fingering charts</li>
            <li>Sheet music for a variety of songs</li>
            <li>Videos of some of the songs available on the site to help you know how they are played</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            Of the songs available, there are many different generes to choose from, such as blues, folk rock, and scores from movies and games!<br>
            I am planning to keep expanding the library of songs available here, so be sure to check back every now and then to see what is new.<br>
            a good place to look for songs is <a href = https://musescore.org/en>musescore</a> if what you are looking for isn't here.
